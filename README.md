# Decision Tree Model Implementation

This project delves deep into the theoretical fundamentals of machine learning by studying the Decision Tree model within the context of learning theory. The entire project was conducted using Google Colaboratory for an assignment in a Machine Learning course.

## Project Overview

This individual project was the second assignment, focusing on Algorithm Implementation. The key aspects of the project are outlined below.

### Highlights

- **Custom Model Training**: Trained the Decision Tree model without relying on pre-built libraries, which enhanced my understanding of the underlying algorithms and processes.
- **Visualization**: Utilized visualization techniques to generate a clear and concise visual representation of the Decision Tree, aiding in the interpretation of the model's decision-making process.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculated essential metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Constructed a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance on test data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters, achieving better results and enhancing its predictive capabilities.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implemented the SMOTE algorithm manually to address the class imbalance, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the model.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Conducted analysis to identify the most influential features contributing to the model's predictions.
- **Pruning Techniques**: Explored pruning techniques to simplify the Decision Tree and prevent overfitting.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Employed ensemble methods such as Random Forest to enhance predictive accuracy.
